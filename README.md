# End to end flight price predictor

In this project I created a web application that can predict fare of a flight.

To check the application please do visit http://flightpricepredictor-env.eba-zf4qs6et.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

This project looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting price of a flight.

### we are going to take following approch:

#### 1. problem defination 
Problem Build a system capable of predicting fare of a flight.

#### 2. data 
Original data came from the kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh/

#### 3. Data preprocessing and EDA

#### 4. Creating a model
I buid two models 
1. XGboost
2. Random Forest

### Deployment
For deploying my web application I used Flask framework and deployed it on aws cloud
